The tribunal had earlier upheld, at least in part, the Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) findings that Google had abused its dominant position in the Android ecosystem to indulge in anti-competitive practices. Alongside Google’s appeal, the Court also admitted related ', 'A bench led by Justice P.S. Narasimha has listed the matter for a detailed hearing in November.', 'The CCI’s investigation into Google began in 2020, sparked by complaints from app developers and industry groups who alleged that Google was using its market dominance in Android to push its own services and restrict fair competition.', 'By 2022, the Commission concluded that Google had engaged in multiple anti-competitive practices. Chief among them was the mandatory use of the Google Play Billing System (GPBS) for in-app purchases on the Play Store. This meant that developers had to use Google’s payment processing system, paying a commission that typically ranged between 15% and 30%, rather than integrating their own billing solutions.\r', 'The regulator also found that Google exempted its own app YouTube from these billing requirements, giving them a cost advantage over competing services. This, the CCI argued, distorted the level-playing field and harmed both rival developers and consumers.\r', 'In addition, the CCI highlighted that the Android licensing model required smartphone makers to pre-install Google’s suite of apps — Search, Chrome, YouTube, and others — as a condition for access to the Google Play Store. According to the Commission, this bundling restricted consumer choice and suppressed innovation from alternative app providers.\r', 'Based on these findings, ', ', ensure transparency in billing data, and refrain from using such data to advantage its own services.', 'Google rejected the CCI’s conclusions, arguing that its practices were designed to enhance user experience, maintain security, and enable a sustainable business model for the Android ecosystem.', 'The company maintained that Android is an open-source operating system, available for free to device manufacturers, and that OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) are not obligated to install Google’s proprietary apps if they choose to license the core Android platform without Play Store access. It argued that pre-installing a set of Google apps was a matter of efficiency and user convenience, and did not prevent users from downloading competing apps.\r', 'On the billing side, Google claimed that GPBS ensured safe and reliable transactions for users, helping to prevent fraud and reduce payment failures. The commission fees, it said, were consistent with industry standards and provided developers access to Google’s global infrastructure, distribution reach, and regular security updates.\r', 'Google also argued that exempting certain in-house services from GPBS was not anti-competitive but a recognition of differences in their business models. It pointed out that many leading Indian apps like PhonePe, Paytm, and Hotstar had grown successfully on Android, which shows that the market remained vibrant and competitive.\r', 'In March, the NCLAT delivered its ruling on Google’s appeal against the CCI’s 2022 order. The tribunal upheld several of the CCI’s findings, agreeing that Google’s mandatory billing policy and bundling of apps amounted to abuse of dominance. However, it reduced the financial penalty from ₹936.44 crore to ₹216.69 crore, reasoning that the original amount was disproportionate to the conduct in question.', 'The NCLAT also struck down some of the CCI’s behavioural directions, holding that certain remedies were either over-broad or lacked sufficient evidentiary basis. In May 2025, following a review petition, the tribunal reinstated two key directions that Google must be transparent about its billing data policies, and that it must not use such data to gain a competitive advantage for its own apps and services.\r', 'This partial victory left all parties dissatisfied. Google sought a complete reversal of the findings, the CCI wanted its original penalties and remedies restored in full, and ADIF argued that the tribunal had gone too easy on Google.\r', 'The case raises fundamental questions about how much control a dominant platform like Android should have over the devices and services it supports, and to what extent regulators can intervene in the name of competition.', 'For consumers, a ruling in favour of the CCI could mean more choice and potentially lower prices. If developers can bypass GPBS and use cheaper payment systems, they might pass on some of the savings to users. Greater transparency and restrictions on data use could also enhance privacy and fairness in app rankings and recommendations. However, industry observers warn that loosening Google’s control could lead to more fragmentation in Android, with different devices offering inconsistent user experiences.\r', 'For smartphone makers, the verdict could influence licensing costs and product flexibility. If the Supreme Court upholds the CCI’s original remedies, OEMs might gain more leeway to pre-install competing services or experiment with alternative Android versions without losing access to the Play Store. This could be especially significant for smaller Indian brands that have struggled to differentiate themselves in a Google-centric ecosystem.\r', 'For Indian startups and app developers, the case represents an opportunity to level the playing field against a global giant. ADIF has argued that Google’s policies not only limit payment options but also give it an undue edge in promoting its own apps. A strong pro-CCI ruling could give local companies better bargaining power and distribution access.\r', 'For Google, the stakes go beyond India. The country is one of its largest markets by user base, and an adverse ruling here could trigger similar regulatory demands in other jurisdictions. It could also force Google to reconsider its global Android business model, especially if courts require it to unbundle services or open its billing systems.\r', 'The Supreme Court’s hearings in November will likely examine both the legal interpretation of “abuse of dominance” under Indian competition law and the economic realities of platform markets. Whatever the outcome, the decision will set an important precedent for how India balances innovation, consumer protection, and market fairness in the digital era. With Android powering over 95% of smartphones in the country, the Court’s ruling will directly influence how hundreds of millions of Indians access apps, make payments, and use mobile services in the years to come.', 'If the case ends with strong enforcement of the CCI’s original directions, India could emerge as a leading example of robust digital market regulation outside the EU. On the other hand, if the Court sides with Google, it will reaffirm the status quo.

The real question is not about its survivability per se, but rather the extent to which it might mutate under pressure from Washington’s coercive policy prescriptions inflicted upon developing and emerging economies, particularly across the Asian region.', 'A few definitional remarks are in order at this point. Firstly, the rules-based international order, a liberal paradigm seen as a remedy to the devastation wreaked by the two World Wars, was brought into existence by the U.S. This was made possible by the U.S. pushing ahead with the Marshall Plan to rebuild war-torn Europe, returning it to a minimum threshold of economic advancement and political stability that would enable the continent to support the global narrative of a unipolar world as envisioned by Washington. Thereafter, a broad set of “norms and institutions that govern international relations as well as broad patterns of power distribution and economic flows across the world, most of it backstopped by American power and leadership” came into force, including the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the International Monetary Fund\xa0(IMF) and the World Bank (as well as the “Washington consensus” that they implied), and a variety of related organisations. All these institutions existed to put guardrails in place for international politics — in other words these organisations were used as leverage to limit the regional and global ambitions of any potential rival to the aforementioned unipolar balance of power.', 'The argument made by some who see the continuation of the rules-based international order even through the turbulence of the Trump years is that throughout the history of Asia’s development, the U.S. has displayed the very same bullying tactics around the region that curbed and shaped the growth trajectory of Asian powerhouse economies. For example, Sandeep Bhardwaj argues that during the post-War years, when Japanese cloth imports of the U.S. outsold American domestic product, the U.S. in 1955 compelled Japan to agree to a voluntary export restriction that capped the latter’s share of the U.S. market. However, the U.S. has equally nurtured the quality of openness within the rules-based order, allowing room for Asian and Latin American economies to periodically assert themselves and play a larger role within limited spaces, thus introducing the necessary element of system flexibility that has helped it endure despite a series of economic and political shocks over the past half century.', 'Examples cited of such openness within Pax Americana include the U.S. and developed nations encouraging developing countries to join the United Nations umbrella of institutions; getting China to join the WTO in 2001 after going slow on global concerns about Beijing’s human rights violations; supporting Japan’s entry to the G-7 in 1973; strongly backing the entry of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Saudi Arabia into the G20; establishing the UN Millennium Development Goals to backstop the financing of industrialisation in emerging economies; and structural adjustment loans from the IMF. These loans, however, were a double edged sword, offering a financial lifeline for Asian countries while benefitting U.S. trade policy by forcing the opening up of these markets.', 'There is no denying that the rules-based international order is far from an authoritarian hierarchy of forced policy prescriptions and expected political genuflection of so-called subordinate Asian nations. Yet, it is fair to ask whether such a warped balance of power in favour of the U.S. could ever emerge, given the Asian trajectory of rapid economic growth built on global trading and capital systems, the collective social emancipation of people, the propagation of individual and institutional liberty, and the growing state capacity for meaningful regional action and collaboration. If the sense of agency and autonomous power of Asian nation-states is overlooked, then it leads to a false sense of U.S. munificence in “bestowing” openness and flexibility upon the rules-based order. In reality, the U.S., for all its economic heft and technological prowess had no choice but to find its own place within this complex matrix of competing nations worldwide, each strong in specific economic sectors, but perhaps less so in other areas.', 'Within this more reasoned paradigm of the global political economy, which neither denies the unipolarity of the present moment nor overstates the U.S.’s ability to impose its hegemonic ambitions on other nations in today’s multi-alliance, interconnected and interdependent framework of international engagement, it becomes clear that damage done to the rules-based liberal international order under the second Trump administration will transform the order to the point of it resembling a new order entirely.', 'Ironically, at the heart of this act of reshaping the rules-based liberal international order, are not so much the consequences of what the U.S. is inflicting upon Asian nations but rather its abrupt pulling of the rug from under the heels of Europe by undermining the ideological cause and financial prospects of NATO and leaving the continent exposed to the risk of ever-increasing depredations of  Russia. ', 'Similarly, the resoluteness with which Mr. Trump has tied his administration to the whims and fancies of the genocidal and warmongering causes of Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu will rewrite the playbook for everyone. This will impact the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Türkiye, rethinking regional political dynamics, as much as it will\xa0aspiring college students from India seeking admissions in countries other than the U.S. in the wake of compulsory social media scrutiny as a condition of visa issuance.', 'Yes, the silhouettes of the old rules-based liberal international order will continue to fall upon the new arrangements that the world will find itself forced to confront by the end of the second Trump term. ', 'However, there can be no denying that it will indeed be a new order built on the rise of bilateral agreements in place of broader regional ones. ', 'The newer order will feature the widespread use of economic sanctions to penalise political opponents across the globe in contravention of WTO norms; ever-growing skirmishes and limited wars; a reliance on drones and AI to settle territorial and other disputes; as well as a steady, catastrophic dismembering of global institutions fostering cooperation, reducing transactions costs and speaking up for human rights and standards of international engagement more broadly.', 'Pax Americana may well give rise to the next phase of its own evolution, Flux Americana.', ' Published ']","[' Published ', '- August 12, 2025 08:30 am IST ', ' Published ', '- August 12, 2025 08:30 am IST']",[]

‘In Gaza, we’re witnessing a man-made crisis, intended to maximise suffering’
 Premium","What we’re seeing in Gaza is not a natural disaster; this is not just a humanitarian emergency in the present, it’s a multi-generational crisis that will have long-lasting effects on Gaza’s people","Updated  
                    British emergency physician Dr. James Smith
                                       As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, medical professionals and aid organisations continue to raise alarms over widespread starvation, severe malnutrition among children, and limited access to critical healthcare.  Since the escalation of conflict in October 2023, the Gaza strip has faced prolonged restrictions on food, water, and medical supplies, prompting international concern about the deliberate obstruction of aid and the long-term public health consequences. In this interview, British emergency physician Dr. James Smith shares his insights based on firsthand experience working in Gaza’s hospitals and his recent attempts to return.  He discusses the challenges faced by healthcare workers, the medical implications of prolonged starvation, and the complexities involved in reintroducing nutrition to malnourished populations.  Dr. Smith also addresses the professional and institutional consequences faced by medical practitioners who speak out about the situation in Gaza, and reflects on the broader role of the global health community in responding to such crises. 
									Yes, I attempted to return twice — in May and June of this year — and on both occasions, the Israeli military denied me entry. This isn’t unusual. Over half of medical professionals trying to access Gaza are rejected, often without explanation. These denials usually come the day before travel from Jordan, making it extremely difficult for small humanitarian teams to operate. Many convoys end up traveling with empty seats.
				 
									The conditions were unlike anything I’ve experienced. Even with strong media coverage, the reality on the ground was far worse — constant bombardment, widespread shortages, and attacks on medical infrastructure. Every protected category — civilians, healthcare workers, journalists — was impacted. I spoke with seasoned humanitarian professionals who said they had never seen such sustained violence at this scale.
				 
									Extremely serious. We saw early signs of malnutrition in January 2024. A month prior, Human Rights Watch warned that Israel was using starvation as a method of warfare. The intentionality is clear — Israeli officials publicly stated within days of the October 2023 escalation that aid, including food and water, would be blocked.
				 
										Throughout 2024, the situation deteriorated. The IPC — an international food security monitoring body — issued repeated warnings about the risk of famine, particularly in northern Gaza. Yet access to aid remained tightly restricted. It appears to be a calculated strategy: enough aid to avoid a technical famine declaration, but insufficient to prevent mass suffering.
				 
									The first 1,000 days of a child’s life are critical. Malnutrition during this window can result in long-term stunting, cognitive delays, and increased vulnerability to chronic diseases later in life.
				 
										In the immediate term, a malnourished child has a weakened immune system and is highly susceptible to infections. It’s not usually malnutrition alone that causes death — it’s malnutrition combined with illnesses like diarrhoea or respiratory infections.
				 
									Refeeding must be done cautiously. Severely malnourished individuals can’t just return to eating normal meals—it puts them at risk of refeeding syndrome, a dangerous condition where sudden nutrient intake causes electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to cardiac issues or even death.
				 
										Proper treatment involves medically supervised nutritional rehabilitation: gradual caloric reintroduction, electrolyte monitoring, and specific micronutrient supplementation. Without these, refeeding can do more harm than good.
				 
									Some effects can be reversed, particularly if intervention comes early. But many of the developmental and physiological impacts of prolonged malnutrition can be permanent. There’s also evidence of intergenerational consequences—the health of future children can be affected by a parent’s malnutrition. So yes, we’re looking at damage that could extend well beyond this generation.
				 
									I have. After publishing in a medical journal, I was temporarily suspended from clinical practice. I’ve been the subject of misleading press coverage and formal complaints, usually accusing me of antisemitism or condoning terrorism—both completely unfounded.
				 
										Even when dismissed, these complaints are exhausting and disruptive. But more troubling is the broader culture of silence in the medical community. Many healthcare workers have faced retaliation for simply speaking out or showing solidarity.
				 
									Absolutely. Palestinian doctors trained in the U.K. have been killed while applying their skills in Gaza, and their institutions have remained silent. That silence is not neutral—it reflects systemic anti-Palestinian bias and an unwillingness to confront the political realities of this crisis.
				 
										We have to ask what it means to be a healthcare professional during a time of mass atrocity. Our institutions are expected to speak out in moments of injustice — yet many have failed to do so.
				 
									Humanitarian aid is essential in the short term, but it’s not the solution. As former UN High Commissioner Sadako Ogata once said,   What we’re seeing in Gaza is not a natural disaster — it’s a man-made political crisis, and it requires a political response.
				 
										The global health community claims to stand for equity and justice, but its response to Gaza has largely been silence. A few individuals have spoken out, but institutions have failed to meet this moment with the urgency and moral clarity it demands.
				 
									That this is not a natural or accidental crisis. Famine and starvation today are always man-made. In Gaza, we are witnessing deliberate deprivation—manufactured scarcity—intended to maximize suffering.
				 
										This is not just a humanitarian emergency in the present. It’s a multi-generational crisis that will have long-lasting effects on physical and mental health, social structures, and the future of an entire population. And that’s what makes it so deeply unjust.

                                       The Bharatiya Janata Party tried to turn the tables on Congress regarding its allegations of ‘vote theft’ with Rajya Sabha MP Lahar Singh Siroya petitioning the Election Commission of India (ECI) on claims by former Union Minister C.M. Ibrahim of ‘purchasing’ 3,000 votes in the 2018 Karnataka Assembly elections to ensure the victory of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Badami. Mr. Ibrahim was once a close associate of Mr. Siddaramaiah.  In a letter to the ECI in Delhi, along with an online link to the contents of Mr. Ibrahim’s speech, Mr. Singh sought an investigation describing the claims of the former Union Minister as an alleged ‘act of electoral crime’. “Mr. Ibrahim, a former union minister and one of Mr. Siddaramaiah’s closest associates and advisors for decades, has made a shocking revelation. He has said that he, along with senior Congress leader B. B. Chimmanakatti, helped purchase 3,000 votes in 2018 so that Mr. Siddaramaiah could scrape through the Assembly election from the Badami seat. In the final count, Mr. Siddaramaiah’s victory margin in Badami was a mere 1,696 votes. It was a humiliating margin for a sitting chief minister. The NOTA votes (2,007) were higher than his victory margin,” Mr. Singh said. “Mr. Ibrahim will do us a great favour if he tells us how, and from whom, he purchased the 3,000 votes to save his friend. He has also said that Mr. Siddaramaiah had paid for this purchase, but took six months to make the payment,” he added.  Pointing out that BJP leader B. Sriramulu had lost the election against Mr. Siddaramaiah in Badami in 2018, Mr. Singh claimed that more details would come out if Mr. Sriramulu spoke about this episode. Taunting Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi for making allegations of vote theft in Bengaluru Central parliamentary constituency, he said, “Mr. Rahul Gandhi has opened a can of worms by coming to Bengaluru a few days back, and making wild allegations about electoral rolls.
